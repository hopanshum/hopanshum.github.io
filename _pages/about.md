<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">About Me</h2>
Hi! I am participating the job market in the Fall of 2024. My research interest is applied theory in network settings. I have worked on projects of network markets, company hierarchies, and polarization.

Prior to the Ph.D. program at Duke, I have studied in the University of Hong Kong for undergraduate and the London School of Economics and Political Sciences for master.
