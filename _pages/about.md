<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">About</h2>
I am an applied theorist who participate the job market in the Fall of 2024. My research is applied game theory in network settings with interests in Industrial Organization, Political Economy, and Urban Economics. I have worked on projects of networked market, company hierarchies, demand estimation, and polarization.

I plan to graduate from Duke in the Spring of 2025. Prior to the Ph.D. program at Duke, I went to the University of Hong Kong for undergraduate study and the London School of Economics and Political Sciences for master study.

I am interested in teaching economics as a part of liberal arts education. I have been instructors and teaching assistants of various courses at Duke, including Intermediate Microeconomics, Game Theory, and Graduate Microeconomics.
