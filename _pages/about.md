<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">About</h2>
I am an applied theorist participating in the job market in the Fall of 2024. My research focuses on applied game theory in network settings, with interests in Industrial Organization, Political Economy, and Urban Economics. I have worked on projects involving networked markets, company hierarchies, demand estimation, and polarization.

I plan to graduate from Duke in the Spring of 2025. Prior to the Ph.D. program at Duke, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Hong Kong and my master’s studies at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

I am interested in teaching economics as part of a liberal arts education. I have been an instructor and teaching assistant for various courses at Duke, including Intermediate Microeconomics, Game Theory, and Graduate Microeconomics.
