<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">About Me</h2>
Hi! I'm Peter Shum, a Ph.D. Candidate in the Economics Department of Duke. I will participate the job market in the Fall of 2024. My research interest is applied theory in network settings. I have worked on projects of network markets, company hierarchies, and bribery.
