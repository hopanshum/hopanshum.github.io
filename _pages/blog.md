A theorist's take on empirical work

problems:
1. bias of positive result
2. date manipulation
3. p-hack
4. unintended prior and statistical power
5. easy application of well-researched models (or even no models at all)
6. policy significance =/= good science

suggestion:
needed:
1. Aspredicted
2. Do the same for data, time stamp it before analysis, be transperant and state who and how collected the data
3. Set out to have an intended prior, e.g. falsifying a known theory

preferred:
work on models that are more complicated than undergraduate theory

doing all this, while conducts a research to my standard, is not going to do well in academia
