<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Diversity Statement</h2>

As an Asian male academic, I am dedicated to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within the academic community. My multicultural upbringing has instilled in me the importance of diverse perspectives, driving my commitment to creating inclusive spaces.

In my research, I focus on alternative explainations to blames on immigrants, such as political polarization, aiming to make a positive impact. In the classroom, I employ inclusive teaching practices, ensuring all students feel valued and heard. I encourage open dialogue on equity and social justice, fostering critical thinking.

I am committed to ongoing professional development in diversity and inclusion, participating in workshops and collaborating on initiatives to enhance inclusivity. At Duke University and any future appointments, I will continue to support efforts that create a welcoming environment for all, contributing to a culture of equity and inclusivity.
