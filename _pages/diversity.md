<h2 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Diversity Statement</h2>

As an Asian male economist, I have a deep-seated commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within both academic and professional settings. My journey through the realms of Applied Game Theory and Industrial Organizations has underscored the importance of diverse perspectives in enriching our understanding of the economy and society.

*Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion*

Throughout my academic career, I have been dedicated to protecting the rights of minorities and historically disadvantaged groups. This commitment is not just theoretical but deeply personal. Two of my closest friends are homosexual, and through my close relationship with them, I have gained a profound understanding of the challenges they face. I actively support them and advocate for their rights, striving to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

*Teaching and Mentorship*

While my opportunities to teach minority students in the classroom have been limited, I am passionate about creating inclusive learning environments. My teaching philosophy, rooted in liberal arts education, emphasizes the importance of diverse viewpoints and the potential of every individual. I believe that economics is not a privileged knowledge reserved for a few but a powerful tool that can benefit anyone. By making economics accessible and relevant to all students, I aim to empower them to use this knowledge to improve their lives and communities.

*International Experience and Cultural Appreciation*

My extensive international experience, having studied in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, and the United States has exposed me to a variety of cultures and perspectives. This exposure has not only broadened my worldview but also deepened my appreciation for diversity. I enjoy engaging with different cultures and believe that this openness enriches both my personal and professional life.

*Belief in Potential and Empowerment*

I firmly believe in the potential of every individual, regardless of their background. My experiences have taught me that diversity is a strength that can lead to greater creativity, innovation, and understanding. By fostering an inclusive environment, I aim to empower individuals to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to our collective knowledge and progress.

In conclusion, my commitment to diversity and inclusion is integral to my work as an economist and educator. I strive to create spaces where all voices are heard and valued, and where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
