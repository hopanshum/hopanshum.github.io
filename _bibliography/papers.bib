  title={The Polarizing Effect of Monopsony},
  author={Peter Shum},
  abstract={In contrast to Hotelling’s Horizontal Differentiation model, polarization of politicians is prevalent throughout political history, and even
more so in the digital age. I develop a model that connects lobbying incentives and the extreme platforms of politicians. 
I show that extreme platforms can arise from uniform preliminaries. The model is also applied to the suburbanization of the manufacturing industry.},

  title={Caught in the Middle: Incentive and Information Hierarchies},
  author={Curtis Taylor and Peter Shum},
  abstract={In large corporations, hierarchies among its employees are usually present. Previous literature establish models where the trans‑
mission of information within a hierarchy mitigates coordination problems in teamwork. This paper endogenizes incentive provision in
such settings. The results predict possibility of “fat top” structures which fits observational findings. This paper provides a novel explana‑
tion of why middle managers suffer particularly in the corporate hierarchies.},

  title={Underinvestment in Buyer‑Seller Network},
  author={Peter Shum},
  abstract={I construct a network formation model for the buyer‑seller networked market from Kranton and Minehart (2001). Agents antici‑
pate resulting network structures and demand a transfer along with the costly link formation. My results predict that with moderate link
formation cost, the potential deviation of the trading partners deters the formation of networked markets. The whole market may vanish
under specific conditions. I also suggest some remedies for this under‑investment.},
